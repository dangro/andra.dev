# Technical Investments

Our typical day-to-day work as engineers falls into projects, and almost all such projects start with a product goal that tends to be time-sensitive. As a result, we discover cases where we would benefit from a technical improvement to our system while attempting to move quickly to build a user-facing feature. 

By necessity, engineers need empowerment to make technical investments pre-emptively, which requires us to carve the necessary time to work on improvements that may take time before any user-facing value they provide is made apparent. The goal is to enable faster turn-around times.

Technical investment prioritization should be cooperative and informed by longer-term plans for the product.
